# Progress log

Newest entry first. Each finished task adds an entry: what was built, what was left out, and what the next session must know. A session that stops half-way writes where it stopped.

## 4 October 2026: task 0.1 Repository skeleton

Built:

- pnpm workspace with Turborepo: `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/calc`, `packages/timetable-rules`, `packages/shared`.
- `apps/api`: NestJS 12 with the eleven empty modules in `src/modules` and the public route `GET /api/health`.
- `apps/web`: Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (Button only). One placeholder page calls the health route and shows "reachable" or "not reachable".
- ESLint, Prettier and Vitest in every package; Playwright with one smoke test; the root scripts named in `CLAUDE.md`. 36 unit and API tests and 1 browser test pass.
- Setup steps in `README.md`; the technical choices in `docs/decisions.md`.

Left out, with the task that brings it:

- Jobs worker in `pnpm dev`: 0.5. `pnpm db:migrate` and `pnpm db:codegen`: 0.2. `pnpm api:client`: 0.4. Until then the three scripts stop with a message.
- Continuous integration: 0.3. `apps/solver`: 5.10. Web feature folders: created with each feature.
- TanStack Router and Query, i18next, AG Grid, Pragmatic drag and drop, Dexie, Socket.IO, Kysely, pg-boss and fast-check are not installed; each comes with the first task that uses it.
- The placeholder page has hard-coded English text and a plain `fetch`. No permission tests and no translations yet (allowed before 0.8c).

The next sessions must know:

- Node 24 is pinned (`.node-version`, `engines`); `pnpm install` refuses another major version. TypeScript stays on 6.0.x. pnpm refuses package versions younger than 24 hours: take the previous version, do not add an exception.
- New shadcn/ui components: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <name> -c apps/web`, then `pnpm format`.
- Do not write files with PowerShell `Set-Content`: it adds CRLF and a byte-order mark. Line endings are LF.
- 0.2: replace the two database stubs in the root `package.json`.
- 0.3: use `.node-version` and `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. The browser test needs `playwright install chromium`; the build plan does not say whether CI runs `pnpm test:e2e`, ask the owner. Tests are slow when all packages run at once (timeouts were raised in `apps/api/vitest.config.ts` and `apps/web/src/test-setup.ts`); watch this in CI.
- 0.4: replace `parseHealthResponse` (`packages/shared`) and the `fetch` in `apps/web/src/App.tsx` with the shared schemas and the generated client. Configuration loading replaces the read of `PORT` in `apps/api/src/main.ts` and should also set the host: today the API listens on all network interfaces. Unknown paths give three different error shapes today (NestJS JSON under `/api`, an Express HTML page outside it, the body parser's own errors). Add the lint rule against reading the system clock. If the OpenAPI document is served over HTTP, that is a new route.
- 0.4 to 0.6c add routes before the permission harness of 0.7 exists. Each must be listed for 0.7.
- 0.7: declare `GET /api/health` public on the handler, not by a list of paths (Express also matches `HEAD`, `/API/HEALTH` and `/api/health/`). The harness must find routes from the running application: the health controller is in `src/health/`, outside `modules/`. Requests to unknown paths never reach a guard. The reviewer also advises that public routes do not refresh a session's last-use time.
- Before 0.7 the owner decides one point: `docs/spec/02-roles-and-access.md` says "Every request passes one permission check on the server" and names no public route. If the health route stays public, the spec may need a line (`/spec-change`).
- 0.8a: i18n replaces the placeholder texts, the `lang` and title in `apps/web/index.html`, and the tests that look for English strings. 0.8a and 0.8b review the look (the `nova` preset and the Geist font came from the shadcn CLI).
- Turborepo's `AGENTS.md` generation is off (`agentGuidance: false` in `turbo.json`). Its anonymous telemetry is on by default on each machine; `pnpm exec turbo telemetry disable` turns it off.

The next task is 0.2.
